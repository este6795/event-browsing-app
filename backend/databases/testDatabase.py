"""
Database Basics: 
- import sqlite3 to import library
- sqliteConnection = sqlite3.connect('filename.db')  Establishing a connection, variable can be any name
- cursor = sqliteConnection.cursor()  Creating a cursor object using the cursor() method, variable can be any name
     - cursor is used to execute SQL commands
     - You must first create a variable that contains the command, then call cursor.execute(variable) to execute it
          - Alternatively, you can call cursor.execute("SQL COMMAND") directly 
     - sqliteConnection.commit()  Saves your changes in the database
     - Use .fetchall() to get all the data from a table
     - To modify data use UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2,â€¦  WHERE condition;
     - To delete data use DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
     - To delete a table use DROP TABLE table_name;
