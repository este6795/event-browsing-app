#This script is just for making the table, logic like email authentication will be elsewhere
#I was hoping to do the RSVPEvents and LikedEvents as a list, all I could find is BLOB, and 
#idk how they work yet (growth mindset)
#but we might just end up needing to treat it like a CSV and cry about it


# RSVP'd events and Liked Events are things we can query up, 
# and are no longer attempting to make part of the table




# HOW TO HANDLE RSVPs
# OPTION A)  This is a Log of RSVPs, which references both Event ID and 
#            ?? Create logic to delete all rsvps of an event once the event is over?
#                     ?? should we create logic to delete an event automatically 24-72 hours after its endDateTime?
#            PRIMARY KEY is (eventID, userWhoRSVPID), there is no singular candidate key






#("Sports","Honors", "Workshops", "Study Session", "Dissertation", "Performance", "Competition", "", "", "", "", "", "", "")
# Event Types - ("")
# departments - ("Art", "Math", "Science", "Computer Science", "History", "Education", "Political Science", "Software Engineering", "Business")


#I'm not sure if/how the AUTO_INC on eventID changes how we input data into the db 
#eventDescription is only 250 characters, could increase if desired

#I'm using mediumblobs because they don't require that I insert a size, as idk what that means
#eventually will switch this back to BLOB(arg), once I understand them better
    #I'm not sure how to do Images, but I think BLOBs will work


#Event Types could be expanded on further, could include each college, each department, 
#Pulling from UNC's list of events, could also reasonably include: 
# "Competition", "Video Games", "Dissertation Defense", "Astronomy"
# I think we should plan for types to be combined, so the 3v3 BBall tourny would be "Sports", "Competition"
# The SET data type allows 0 or more from selected type

#I think numberofLikes INTEGER(6) means that val has 6 digits, could be wrong
