#I'm not sure if/how the AUTO_INC on eventID changes how we input data into the db 
#eventDescription is only 250 characters, could increase if desired

#I'm using mediumblobs because they don't require that I insert a size, as idk what that means
#eventually will switch this back to BLOB(arg), once I understand them better
    #I'm not sure how to do Images, but I think BLOBs will work


#Event Types could be expanded on further, could include each college, each department, 
#Pulling from UNC's list of events, could also reasonably include: 
# "Competition", "Video Games", "Dissertation Defense", "Astronomy"
# I think we should plan for types to be combined, so the 3v3 BBall tourny would be "Sports", "Competition"
# The SET data type allows 0 or more from selected type

#I think numberofLikes INTEGER(6) means that val has 6 digits, could be wrong
